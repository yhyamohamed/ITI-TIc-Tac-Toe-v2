The two players take turns putting marks on a 3x3 board. The goal of Tic Tac Toe game is to be one of the players to get three same symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally on a 3 x 3 grid. The player who first gets 3 of his/her symbols (marks) in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game, and the other loses the game. The game can be played by two players.

- A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his mark (“X” or “O”) and their aim is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or  diagonally with two intensions:
a. One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.
b. If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a draw/tie.
